# 1.简单句

- 英语必须具备主谓结构，并且主语一定是谓语动作的发出者，如果有宾语的话，宾语一定是谓语动作的承受者。

## 分类

1. 主谓结构；

   - he died.
   - we laugh.

2. 主谓宾结构；

   - 谓语：实意动词(有实际意义的词)
   - 生活中大部分动词都是实意动词

3. 主谓表结构(即主系表)；

   - 谓语：系动词
     - 1.be 动词
     - 2.感官动词：look,small,taste,sound,feel;
     - 3.变化：become,get;
     - 4.保持：keep,stay,remain;

4. 主谓双宾；

5. 主谓宾宾补；

   - I bought him a dog.我给他买了一条狗

   - It makes him happy.这让它很高兴。
     - 第一句是双宾，第二句是宾宾补，
     - 双宾是由两部分单独的部分，没关系；而宾补是对宾语的补充说明，是有关系的。
     - 可以在两个部分之间加一个be动词判断是否有关系进行判断
       - 例如：him is a dog.逻辑不通
       - him is happy.可以说明状态，是宾补

## 句子的成分(词性的问题)

### 一.谓语： 

- 1.1谓语的成分；
- **有时态的实意动词或者是系动词充当谓语**
  
- 1.2一句话当中动词能不能多？

  - 绝对不能，一句话当中只能有一个动词的存在并且充当谓语，多余的动词全部都要变成非谓语动词，所以英语中有了独立主格和分词作状语。

  - 谓语只能是动词；
  - 动词只能做谓语；
  - 所有我们需要把一句话当中所有不做谓语的动词全部都要变成不是动词
    - 把动词变成不是动词：即(非--谓语动词)
    - 1.加ing:表示主动；
    - 2.加ed:表示被动；
    - 3.加to do:表示目的；
    - 动词的反义词--非 谓语动词；

- 翻译：

  - 他拍了拍我的肩膀，一句话都没说就离开了。

    - He beating my shoulder,saying nothing,departed.
      - 只有departed是谓语动词

  - 我爱你，你爱我。

    - 有两个动词，如果分不清哪个动词最重要一般选择最后一个动词作谓语。

    - I loving you, you love me.
    - l把两句话写成一句话，这就是独立主格。

  - 冬天来了，春天就不远了。

    - Winter approaching, spring will be around the corner.
      - 只有be是谓语动词

  - 我是一个老师，我喜欢唱歌。

    - Being a teacher, I enjoy singsing,
    - Being这个分词做状语，enjoy是谓语动词

- 1.3一句话中动词能不能少？
- **绝对不能少，当一句话中需要动词而又没有动词的时候永远都加be动词，并且be动词没有意思。**
  
- **谓语的总结：一句话当中有且只能有一个有时态的实意动词或者是系动词的存在，并且充当谓语。**

- She love me.
  - 这不是一个句子，因为love这个动词没有时态的变化

### 二.主语：

1. 主语的成分：

   - 名词
   - 代词
   - 非 谓语动词

   - 从句：引导词加句子

2. 一句话中主语能不能少？

   - 绝对不能，那一句话中没有主语的时候怎么办呢？

- 北京的天气很冷

  - It feels strikingly cold in beijing.

  - 2.1加it作为主语必须和温度有关系
  - 2.2it必须和天气，时间，温度有关系

- 有很多的原因可以解释我的观点

  - There remain/exit/seem...(翻译成有...)
  - There remain an ocean of elements being responsible for my perspective.

3. 人称代词做主语都可以写成被动
   - 越来越多的人认为污染很严重
   - Pollution is claimed exceeding grave by an increasing amount individuals.
4. 什么时候使用人称代词做主语？
   - 如果有毅力就一定会成功
   - if there seem persistence, glories cannot fail to be attained.

### 三.宾语：

- 宾语是动作的受体，是个东西，所以是名词性的。
  - I fucked him.
  - He fucked a dog.
  - 我日了他，他日了狗。
- him, dog就是宾语。

### 四.表语：

- 主要是表述主语的属性，可以是名词形容词介词短语不定式或者句子，大多数是跟在be动词后面的，偶尔也会跟着连系动词
  - He is being fucked.
  - The dog is raped.
  - 他被艸了，狗被日了。
- being fucked，raped就是表语。

### 简单句的考点分析

1. 写作
   - 1.1写作中所有写不来的单词都写成自己会写的词汇，反正老师看不懂。
   - 1.2所有写不来的长难句都写成简单句。
2. 分析长难句的第一步就是找动词，也就是谓语，从而找到主语；如果一句话中有多个动词，只需找到主句的谓语动词(前面没有引导词的动词就是谓语动词)



# 2.并列句

1. 什么是并列句？
   - 用连词连接两个句子
2. 五种关系的连词：
   - 平行关系：and, not only...but also
   - 转折关系：but, yet, while, whereas
   - 选择关系：or
   - 递进关系：then
   - 因果关系：for, so

## 并列句的考点分析

1. 写作：只要写作的上下句之间有逻辑关系，就一定要用逻辑关系词(连词，介词短语，副词)
   - 有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎。
   - There exist a train of companies coming from the distance, and as a consequence I become more than delighted.
2. 连词和其他逻辑关系词的区别:
   - 连词的前面要么用逗号，要么没有标点符号；而其他的逻辑关系词的前面要么用句号，要么加连词and 
3. **长难句分析：只要见到有并列连词的出现，一般都会有省略，翻译的时候先把省略的部分补上之后再做翻译。那如何查找省略的内容呢？**
   - 一句话只要有省略就一定会省略在连词后，而不是省略在连词前
   - 所以连词后有的成分连词前通常有
     - 如果连词后只有一个成分，连词前一定能找到他的对应成分；
     - 如果连词后有多个成分，连词前不一定都能找到他们的对应成分，但是至少能找到一个对应成分。
   - 连词前面有，连词后面没有的成分便是省略的内容
4. **分析长难句第二步就是找连词（当连词在连接两个单词的时候这个连词就当没看见）**
5. **分析长难句的第三步就是找定语**
6. **分析长难句的第四步就找状语**



## 介词短语，副词

- 平行：

equally, likewise, similarly, at the same time, in the meanwhile

- 转折

however, nevertheless, conversely, unexpectedly, on the contrary, by constrast

- 转折

alternatively, besides, furthermore, moreover,in addition, subsequently

- 递进

Thus, therefore, as a consequence/result, consequently



- Do you still keep the day in mind? I failed to pass CET4, and onsequently, I shed tears alone in the rain. At the same time, you came up to me then beat my shoulder, telling me "there exist no destination in life".

```
你还记得那一天吗?我没有通过英语四级考试，接着，我在雨中独自流泪。与此同时，你走过来拍我的肩膀，告诉我“人生没有终点”。
```

   ```

5. AS families move away from their stable community,their friends of many years,and their extended family relationships<u>,the informal flow of information is cut off and with it the confidence that information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and reliable.</u>

   ```
   随着家庭离开他们原来稳定的社区，离开他们多年的朋友和扩展的家庭关系，非正式的信息流动被切断了，随之而去的是对在需要时能获得可靠和值得信赖的信息的信心。
   ```

   ```
   直到这些问题被解决，一种行为技术将继续被拒绝并且和行为技术一起可能的是解决我们问题的唯一方法也将继续被拒绝。

## 什么是名词性从句

名词在句子中能够充当的成分，从句都能从当，这就是名词性从句，名词性从句一共包括四类：

1. 主语从句
2. 宾语从句
3. 表语从句
4. 同位语从句

### 名词性从句的引导词

1. 她已经离婚了是显而易见的。
   - <u>That</u> she has got divorced is conspicuous.
2. 她离婚了吗？是一个秘密。
   - <u>Whether</u> has she got divorced keeps a secret.(X)
     - whether翻译成是否，has she got divorced也带有是否的含义，需要把has she got divorced暗含的是否去掉，直接改为陈述句
   - <u>Whether</u> she has got divorced keeps a secret.(√)
3. 她什么时候离婚的是一个谜。
   - <u>When</u> did she get divocred remains a mystery.(X)
   - <u>When</u> she got divocred remains a mystery.(√)

- 名词性从句的引导词是按照从句的类型分的类，一共把引导词分成了三类：
  - 1.that：当从句是陈述句时，并且that在从句中不充当任何成分，也没有任何意思
  - 2.whether：当从句是一般疑问句时，并且wether在从句中不充当任何成分
  - 3.所有的特殊疑问词：当从句是特殊疑问句时。
    - 并且英语中所有的疑问句一定是陈述句的形式，也就是引导词+主语+谓语的形式。



练习：

1. 我正在思考外星人存在吗？
   - I am wondering whether the alien exists.
2. 他们为什么离开家乡去西藏是一个谜
   - Why they left their hometown for Tibet remains a mystery.

- 名词性从句中的长难句考点分析：

  - 能够快速识别各个名词性从句，并且把他们通顺的翻译出来

- **如何识别主语从句：**

  - 引导词放在句首的有可能是主语从句和状语从句；

  - 只要见到有引导词放在句首，并且从句后没有被逗号隔开，就绝对是主语从句，主语从句从句首开始到主句的谓语动词之前结束；

  - 除此以外只要见到 it...that 通常也是主语从句，主语从句从that开始到句末结束；

  - 1.(That the plates are moving) is now beyond this dispute.

  - ```
    板块在移动，这一点现在已无可争议。
    ```

  - 2.(Whether the Government should increase the financing of pure science at the expense of technology or vice versa) often (depends on) (issue) (of which) is seen as the driving force.

  - ```
    政府是应该以牺牲技术为代价来增加对纯科学的资助，还是应该以牺牲技术为代价来增加纯科学的资助，这往往取决于将哪个问题视为驱动力。
    ```

  - 3.(How well the predictions will be validated by later performance) (depends upon) (the amount,reliability,and appropriateness) of the information used (and) on the skill and wisdom with which it is interpreted.

  - ```
    这些预测在多大程度上将被后来的表现所证实，这取决于所使用信息的数量、可靠性和适当性，以及解释这些信息的技能和智慧。
    ```

  - 4.It is generally agreed that a person (of high intelligence) is one who can grasp ideas readily,make distinctions,reason logically,and make use of verbal and mathematical symbols in solving problems.

  - ```
    人们普遍认为，一个高智商的人是一个能很快理解思想，区分，逻辑推理，并使用语言和数学符号解决问题的人。
    ```

  - 5.For example,it has long been known that 【total sleep deprivation is 100 percent fatal to rats,yet,upon examination of the dead bodies,the animals look completely normal.】

  - ```
    例如，人们早就知道，完全剥夺睡眠对老鼠是百分之百致命的，然而，在检查尸体时，这些动物看起来完全正常。
    ```

## 宾语从句

- 如果识别宾语从句：只要实意动词后面有引导词，就暂定为宾语从句（还可能是状语从句哟！）

1. She said that she would marry an old rich man.
2. I wonder if i can pass the National Postgraduate Entrance Examination smoothly.
3. You have all heard it repeated that men of science work by means of induction(归纳法)and deduction(演绎法),that by the help of these operations,they,in a sort of sense, manage to extract from Nature certain natural laws,and that out of these , by some special skills of their own,they build up their theories.

## 表语从句

- 只要系动词的后面有一个引导词，就一定是表语从句。

习题：

1. This alone demonstrates that the television business is not an easy world to survive in.A fact underlined by statistics shows that out of eight European television networks no less than 50% took a loss in 1989.
2. Galileo's greatest glory was that in 1609 he was the first person to turn the newly invented telescope on the heavens to prove that the planets revolve around the sun rather than around the Earth.

## 同位语从句

- 如果识别同位语从句：只要名词后面有个引导词，就暂定为同位语从句(可能性很小)，绝大可能性还是定语从句。

1. A century ago,Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears.
2. But the idea that the journalist must understand the law more profoundly than an ordinary citizen rests on an understanding of the established conventions and special responsibilities of the news media.
3. Evidence came up that specific speech sounds are recognized by babies as young as 6 months old.

# 4.修饰名词的成分——定语

## 一、概念

- 什么是定语？
  - 只要听到.....的+名词；......的就是修饰这个名词的定语成分

## 二、定语的成分

1. 形容词修饰名词；
   - The native nightingale lost his life.
2. 名词修饰名词；
   - The singing of the nightingale enables the rose to bloom.
3. 介词短语作定语修饰名词；
   - The nightingale out of the window heard the sigh of the youngester.
4. 非 谓语动词作定语；
   - The singing nightingale died pitifully.
   - = the nightingale  to sing died pitifully.
5. 从句修饰名词；

## 三、定语的位置

- 前小后大：定语是一个单词就放名词前，是多个单词就放名词后。避免头重脚轻的原则。
  - 1.特殊用法：形容词修饰不定代词的时候放在不定代词的后面；
  - The boy discarded looks pitiful.(当过去分词修饰名词的时候即使只有一个单词，也通常放在名词后)；
    - 后置定语只用过去分词修饰，表示被动，不加be动词；其本质是looks已经充当谓语了，其他动词全都要变成非谓语。
- 这是一个关于夜莺和玫瑰的故事。
  - This is a fiction about a nightingale and a rose.

- 那个懂爱的年轻人离开了王子的舞会。
  - The youngster grasping romance left the party of the prince.

## 四、定语从句的引导词

1. 构成：n+引导词+句子；
2. **引导词：定语从句的引导词是按照先行词的种类分的类，一共把引导词分成5类；**
   - 当先行词是人：who, whom, whose
   - 当先行词是物：that, which, whose
   - 当先行词是时间：that, which, when
   - 当先行词是地点：that, which, where
   - 当先行词是原因：that, which, why



**到底是谁决定了定语从句的引导词？**

1. I will never forget the day <u>when</u> I met you.
   - 两部分的句子都是完整的，不需要引导词充当宾语成分，就不需要使用that/which，而when是副词，只能作状语，和这个句子成分完全不冲突，所以使用when作为引导词
2. I will never forget the day <u>which/that</u> we spent.
   - 从句缺宾语，所以使用that/which都可以，而when是副词，不能作宾语
3. You had better have no reason <u>why</u> you are late.
   - 从句句子完整，不需要that/which充当成分，所以用why
4. You had better have no reason <u>that/which</u> sounds perfect.
   - 从句缺主语，不能用呢why



**从句引导词的决定因素：**

1. 先行词；
2. 引导词在从句中能够充当的成分；这两部分共同决定了定语从句引导词的用法。



**定语从句引导词的分类新标准：**

- 还可以按照引导词本身的词性来分类：一共把引导词分成三类
  1. 代词（在从句中一定要充当主语或者是宾语的成分）：
     - who, whom, that, which
  2. 副词（在从句中不能充当主语或宾语的成分）：
     - where, when, why
  3. 形容词（在从句修饰离它最近的那个名词）：
     - whose



- 夜莺用生命换来的玫瑰花被扔掉了。
  - The rose <u>that/which</u> the nightingale exchanged with his life was discarded.
- 这个男人在他儿子到达的那天去世了。
  - The senior citizen passed away on the day <u>when</u> her son arrived.
    - 虽然arrived后没有明确的宾语，但是这句话的意思很完整，所以不缺宾语
- 我喜欢家里有钱的男生。
  - Boys <u>whose</u> families keep wealthy never fail to fascinate me.

## 五、定语从句的特殊用法

1. 如果先行词和引导词之间有介词的话，人不用who，只能用whom，物不用that，只能用which。
   - I will never forget the day on <u>which</u> I met you.
   - He is the man from <u>whom</u> we should learn.
2. 区别限制和非限制性定语从句。
   - I love my tecacher, who looks elegant.我喜欢我的老师，她很漂亮。
   - I love my tecacher who looks elegant.我喜欢我那漂亮的老师。
   - 非限制性定语从句在长难句分析的时候就相当于插入语，可以完全不看。
3. that引导的定语从句如果在从句充当的是宾语，that可以省略。
   - The rose the nightingale exchanged with his life was discarded.
   - 在见到长难句时，两个名词和代词放在一起，中间没有被任何标点符号或连词隔开，此时通常都是省略了that的定语从句
4. the same...that.../the same...as...
   - He is the same man that I love.他就是我爱的那个男人。
   - He is the same man as I love.他就像我爱的那个男人。

## 六、定语从句考点分析

1. 写作：只要在作文中见到名词都可以给它加一个定语的成分把句子拉长。
   - 养宠物可以增加乐趣。+定语拉长....
     - Raising pets (cute as well as smart) can add interest (of senior citizens who love alone.)
   - 读书有...好处。
     - Reading books (such as *little prince, a nightingale and a rose, and my father and my mother*) can broaden horizen (of all ordinary citizens.)
       - such as 细节论证观点。
   - 我咋天去逛街了，我遇见了一个女生，她的妈妈看起来很漂亮。
     - When I went shopping yesterday, I came across a lady whose mother looked elegant.
     - I,going shopping yesterday, came across a lady whose mother looked elegant.
   - 黄色是专为皇帝所使用的颜色，普通百姓是禁止使用的。
     - Yellow which is foribidden for odinary citizens is designed for the king.
2. 长难句分析：
   - 能够找到一句话当中的定语成分，并且把他们通顺的翻译出来。
   - 找定语的关键是找名词，只要名词后有一坨东西，只要这一坨东西不是谓语动词就暂定为修饰这个名词的定语成分(状语也有可能哟!)
   - 定语从名词后开始到主句的谓语动词之前结束；
   - 如果主句的谓语动词在定语之前的话，定语就从名词后开始通常到句末结束；但是如果定语后有连词出现的，定语不是到句末结束，而是到连词之前结束；
   - 一个大定语中通常都会有无数个小定语，翻译时候从后往前翻译；
   - 每一个小定语都是到下一个名词结束，固定搭配除外；
   - 区别定语从句和同位语从句： 
     - I have a dream that sounds ridiculous.(定语从句)
     - I have a dream that I will become a rich lady.(同位语从句)
     - 读从句本身的意思：定语从句是对前面名词的修饰，同位语从句是对前面名词意思的解释；
     - 看引导词that在从句中是否充当成分，如果充当了成分就是定语从句，如果没有充当成分就是同位语从句；
     - 定语从句是对前面名词的修饰，同位语从句是对前面名词的解释；
     - 定语从句的先行词可以是所有名词，而同位语从句的先行词只能是抽象名词;
     - 定语从句的引导词有8个，而同位语从句的引导词通常都是that;
3. 习题
   - AS families move away from their stable community,their friends of many years,and their extended family relationships,the informal flow of information is cut off and with it the confidence 【that information will be available when needed and will b trustworthy and reliable.】同位语
   - In short, a leader 【of the new school】 contends, "the scientific revolution,as we call it, was largely the improvement and invention and 【[use of a series of instruments] that [expanded] the reach of science in innumerable directions."】                   小主语                                        小谓语             小宾语

     - 这是一个主谓宾结构，主语是由Whether ...or...并列的两个动词不定式充当主语， or both之间省略了to use,谓语是depends，宾语是由两个名词构成的，第一个是the evidence ，第二个是such factors。
   - Some 【of these causes】 are completely reasonable results 【of social needs】.Others are reasonable consequences 【of particular advances /【定语1】in being to some/【定语2】 extent self-accelerating.】
   - In short, a leader of the new school contends, "the scientific revolution,as we call it, was largely the improvement and invention and use of 【a series of instruments/定1 that expanded the reach/定2 of science/定3 in innumerable directions./定4"】
   - Creating a "European identity" that 【respects the differents cultures and traditions】 【which go to make up the connecting fabric】 of 【the Old Continent is no easy task and demands a strategic choice.】

## 七、定语和定语从句的至难点

- The words used by the speaker may stir up unfavorable reactions in the listener C interfere with his comprehension ;hence,the transmission-reception system breaks down.
  A:who    B:as    C:which    D:what
  - 寻找先行词：(依次对应着五个句子的顺序)
    1. 离他最近的名词；
    2. 定语从句的先行词是离他最近的几个并列的名词；
    3. 定语从句的先行词是离他最近的那个从句；
    4. 定语从句的先行词是前面的整个句子；
    5. 定语从句的先行词和引导词之间被一坨东西隔开了；

- For workers it can mean an end to the security, benefits and sense of importance that came from being a loyal employee.

1. 谓语

## 二、动词的分类

1. 系动词：

   - be
   - 感官动词
   - 保持
   - 变化

2. 助动词：就是在一句话中帮助谓语构成时态、构成被动、构成否定和疑问的词

   - I am having english....
     - am是助动词帮助having构成现在进行时,having是谓语
   - I am going to be lawyer.
     - am going to是助动词，be是谓语动词

     - am是助动词，帮助beaten谓语构成现在分词

3. 情态动词：表明说话人主观态度的词

   1. 情态动词表示现在对将来的推测：情态动词+动词原形
   2. 情态动词表示对过去的推测

   - Old fish must be wealthy.
   - must的否定：Old fish cannot be wealthy.
   - Old fish must have been self-biased in his university.

4. 实意动词

   - 不及物动词：必须加介词才能加名词，并且不及物动词后可以不加宾语；

- He will divorce.(X)
- He will divorce his wife.
- He will get divorced.

## 三、虚拟语气

### 一般用法：

- 表示与事实相反或语气委婉；

1. 一般用法：if引导的条件状语从句；
   - 如果你是我眼中的一滴泪，我就永远不会失去
   - If you are a tear in my eyes, I will never shed it.(条件状语从句)
   - 如果咋天晚上我是一条狗，我就能和你们睡在床上了；
   - If I was a dog last night,I could sleep in bed.(条件状语从句)
2. 如果把一个正常的条件状语从句变成虚拟语气呢？
   - 只需要把已经写好的句子的时态变成过去式就行了:
   - 虚拟语气：If you were a tear in my eyes, I would never shed it.
   - 虚拟语气：If I had been a gog last night,I could have slept in bed.(如果本来就是过去式就变成过去完全时)
3. 在虚拟语气中be动词的过去式只有were没有was，还并且would=could=might;
   - 如果下辈子我还记得你，我们还要在一起。
   - If I remembered you in my next life, We would definitely stay together.
   -  如果每一个年轻人都沉迷于追星，
   - If every teenager and youngerster were addicted to pursue celebrities, they would pay a heavy price in the near future.(X)
     - every修饰时都是单数，they要改为he

### 特殊用法：

1. 以下情况从句用should加动词原形表示虚拟，并且should可以省略；
   - 以防： in case that / lest / for fear that
   - 命：order / direct / command
   - 贱：advise / suggest / propose
   - 要求：ask / request / demand / require 
   - 用虚拟：
   - 是必要的：it is necessary that 

- 这几天下场雪是有必要的
  - It is necessary that it should snow these days.



2. 以下情况从句用一般过去式表示虚拟：
   - would rather 宁愿.../ it is high time that 是...的时候了- 

- 是我们关注这个话题的时候了。
  - It is high time that all children and adults shed light on the issue.
- 我宁愿你比我幸福。
  - I'd rather you were happier than I am.



3. 以下情况要区别对待：就是把它本来的时态变成它的过去式
   - wish(一般都是无法实现的愿望) 
   - or 
   - if only 如果...该多好呀 
   - but for 要不是...
   - as if / as though 好像，似乎

- She talks with me as if she were my mother.
- 虚拟：She talked with me last nignt as if she had been my mother.



# 6.形容词和副词

## 一、成分

1. 形容词：放在系动词的后面做表语，放在名词的前面做定语；
   - 只修饰名词
2. 副词：只做状语
   - She runs away rapidly. 
     - 副词修饰实意动词，副词做状语
   - She looks distinctly rapid.
     - 副词修饰形容词，副词做状语
   - She runs away extremely rapidly.
     - 副词修饰副词，副词做状语
   - Actually, she runs away.
     - 副词修饰后面那件事，副词做状语

## 二、什么是状语

- 状语就是在一句话中修饰实意动词，修饰形容词，修饰副词以及修饰整个句子的成分就是状语；
- 状语除了不修饰名词，其他都可以修饰；

#### 状语的成分

1. 副词 adv.

2. 介词短语作状语

   - She runs away **as repidly as a crazy dog.**

3. 非谓语动词作状语

   - She runs away, opens her mouth.

   - She runs away **when she opens her mouth.**

#### 状语的位置

- 随便放！

#### 状语从句

- when / where / because / if / Seeing that(因为...)

- 状语从句的引导词是按照引导词本身的意思分的类，一共把引导词分成九类；

1. 原因状语从句：
   - 翻译为因为:because, as, since, in that, seeing that,
   - 既然，由于：now that
   - 连词：for,放在两个句子的中间
   - 介词短语：because of / owing to / due to / think to / for the sake of / as a result

- Immense anounts of peers fail to be facinated with me for I remain graceful.
- Immense anounts of peers fail to be facinated with me because of my graceful.



2. 让步状语从句：
   - although , even though, if, as, while
   - while翻译成“虽然，尽管”的意思时，只能放在句首，不能放在句中；
   - Surfing on the internet exerts great influence on the physical and mental health of youngsters on the campus although it can make the life convenient.



3. 比较状语从句：as...as...  /  than
   - You are happier than I am.
   - You are happier than I do. do可以替换am，都是助动词
   - You are happier than I. am/do可以省略



4. 方式状语从句：
   - by / by means of / in...way/manner (介词短语作状语) 通过...的方式
   - as / as if / as though 好像，似乎
   - He looks as if he were made of ice.



5. 目的状语从句：
   - so that / in order to (从句表示目的)
   - to / in order to / so as to (动词不定式表示目的)
   - We ascend higher so that we overlook further.
   - We ascend higher in order to overlook further.



6. 结果状语从句：so...that 如此...以至于...
   - 只要作文中出现形容词或副词的地方，都可以写成so...that...句型
   - My mother remains so  kind that she respected by all her staff.
   - I become so rejoiced that I fail to fall asleep at night.



7. 时间状语从句：通常由before,when,while,until这四个连词引导；
8. 地点状语从句：通常由where引导，也可由wherever，anywhere和everywhere引导。

#### 状语和状语从句的考点分析

1. 写作：
   - I love you in my deep mind.
   - 作文中任何一句话的旁边都可以加一个状语的成分把句子拉长；
2. 长难句分析：能够快速识别一句话中的状语成分并能够通顺的翻译出来；
   - 如何识别状语：只要在句子中见到一下的一坨东西就一定是状语
     - 副词
     - 原因 
     - 让步 
     - 方式
     - 比较
     - 条件
     - 结果 so...that
     - 目的
   - 如果名词后出现时间和地点的话，有可能是定语也可能是状语，当无法确定是定语或状语的时候，定语优先原则，只有翻译成定语读起来巨恶心无比的时候才翻译为状语；
     - I love the boy in the university.
     - 我喜欢大学里的这个男生(定语翻译)  / 我喜欢的这个男生在大学里(状语翻译)
3. 习题
   - The Greeks assumed that the structure of language had some connection with the process of thought,which took root [in Europe] long [before people realized how diverse languages could be].
   - Social science is that branch of intellectual enquiry which seeks to study humans and their endeavors [in the same reasoned,orderly,systematic,and dispassioned manner] that natural scientists use for the study of natural phenomena.
   - The behavioral sciences have been slow to change partly because the explanatory items often seem to be directly observed and partly because other kinds of explanations have been hard to find.
   - [Traditionally],legal learning has been viewed [in such institution] as the special preserve of lawyers,rather than a necessary part of the intellectual equipment of an educated person.  
   - While it is easy to ignore in our contact with them the effect of our acts upon their disposition,it is not so easy ad in dealing with adults.
   - We are obliged to them because some of these languages have since vanished as the peoples who spoke them died out or became assimilated and lost their native languages.
     - 补充as：
       1. As+n 作为
       2. V+n+as 此时的as取决于前面名词的意思
       3. As+句子 as的句子只能根据前后文的意思推
   - I shall define him as an individual who has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life the activity of thinking in Socratic(苏格拉底的)way about moral problems.
